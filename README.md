# Mini-Project-on-cpp
Various mini project on cpp                                                                                                                                               
Project No. 1 In this project, i had explained how memory allocation in done in memory using algorithm firstFit, next Fit and Best fit. I explained this with the help of               Linked list.                                                                                                                                              
Project No. 2 In this project, i had explained how we can multiply two numbers which is larger than 64-bit.                                                               
Project No. 3 In this project, i had explained how we can apply shortest job first algorithm of operating system using cpp.                                               
Project No. 4 In this Project, i had explained how we can add two numbers which is larger than 64-bit                                                                     
Project No. 5 In this Project, We had implemented Reader-Writer algorithm of process synchronisation.                                                                     
Project No. 6 In this Project, We had implemented various algorithm to solve real life problems.
